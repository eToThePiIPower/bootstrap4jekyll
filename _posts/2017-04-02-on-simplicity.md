Over the past few years I've fallen into the habit of trying to start blogging
regularly, only to fall into the same trap over and over. While I could rattle
off the reasone, it really comes down to one thing: a lack of *simplicity*.

I get too caught up in the technical aspects of blogging, rather than the
expressive act of writing in itself. Crafting the 'perfect' theme, tuning the
css, implementing every feature I might possibly use some day. And as a
perfectionist, I'm strongly acquainted with the notion that 'the perfect is the
enemy of the done,' which I never seem to be. Hence, the oft-repeated failure
to publish.

That's why I've decided to take a step back and try something new. This time my
theme will be simple: no extraneous features, certainly nothing implemented
before I need it. No strong deviation from Bootstrap's default typography; it's
well done as it is, especially with Bootstrap 4's display headings, so why send
time on type when I can spend time typing on what I'm passionate about?

I may release this Jekyll theme some day. Probably not until Bootstrap 4 hits a
final release. Until then, I'm going to focus less on writing Jekyll and more on
writing *in* Jekyll.
