November is National Novel Writing Month, and I'm taking a **novel**[^1] approach
to it (ha, get it? Never mind...)

Although not strictly speaking a novel, since I keep meaning to keep an active,
interesting blog going---and keep finding myself too worried about
"perfectionism" and what other might think to actually write after the first
post or two---I'm making a commitment to writing a post a day, rain or shine.

<!-- more -->

I have a few ideas for upcoming posts, including old drafts I never
finished[^2], a few micro-projects I'm working on, and probably some general
non-tech but still geeky stuff.

Stay tuned. Really, I mean it this time.

[^1]: Or apparently not. Just did a quick internet search before posting this, and apparently NaBloPoMo is a thing. A thing that doesn't roll off the tongue anywhere near as easily as NaNoWriMo.

[^2]: And will probably break up into more easily managed chunks. Learning not to go off on tangents is a problem of mine[^3].

[^3]: Case in point. At least I know footnotes can have footnotes now.
