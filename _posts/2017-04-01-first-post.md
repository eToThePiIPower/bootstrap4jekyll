Welcome to Jekyll Bootstrap, a new from-scratch iteration at a Jekyll theme,
written using [Bootstrap v4](http://getbootstrap.com). This *first paragraph* will appear in the index
summary, complete with **styling**.

This post can be font in the `_posts` directory, following the convention of

# How to Use Jekyll

Jekyll offers all the power of Markdown, along with extended support for code
snippets and other useful tech blogging tools. Code can be included in the
standard Markdown form:

```ruby
class Dog
  def bark
    puts 'woof'
  end
end
#=> prints 'woof'
```

Or using Jekyll's Liquid syntax:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
class Dog
  def bark
    puts 'woof'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
