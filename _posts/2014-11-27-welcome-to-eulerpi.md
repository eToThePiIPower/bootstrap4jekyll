Hello, and welcome to my blog, EulerPi! I'm Charles, a software developer based
in New York City. Since I already have a [biography](/about) available, I'll
spare you the gory details about my life here and instead talk a bit about what
I intend to make out of this blog.

# About this blog

First and foremost, this will be a blog about software development and IT
administration, although other topics I find interesting such as gaming (analog
and digital), science, math, technology, and in general anything geeky, will
turn up from time to time. Expect most of my posts to focus on Mac and/or Linux
development (I don't use Windows, but I welcome any comments pointing out
Windows-specific quirks or differences). I am by no means an expert, so take
everything I write as the word of an enthusiastic junior engineer encountering
new technologies rather than an ninja guru sharing his experience. Always feel
free to point out my errors in the comments section

Why am I writing this blog? Primarily to help expand my skills in development
and communication. In my past career in education I've learned the truth that
teaching is one of the best ways to learn, so I hope that by writing about what
technologies I'm learning I'm able to come to a better, fuller understanding of
them. Meanwhile, as a decidedly analytical thinker I know that the best way to
expand my skills in communicative and technical writing is through practice.

# Technical Details

This blog is written in [OctoPress][octopress], an extension of Jekyll, a
framework for generating static page blogs written in Ruby and using YAML and
Markdown for authoring posts. I chose Octopress because I'm comfortable with
Ruby, which makes extending and writing plugins easy, because I love Markdown
and how easily writing posts in Markdown integrates with version control in git,
and because for a blog with a single author static pages provides an extremely
secure and performant alternative to a dynamically generated CMS.

Editing is done in a combination of Vim and [Github Atom][atom], the new
open-source editor gearted towards software developers. Hosting is provided by
[Divshot][divshot], a web host which makes static-page development as easy as
[Heroku][heroku] does for dynamic sites. Development and authoring is done
on both Mac OSX and Linux Mint.

I have more to say on this subject, so much that I'm planning it for a future
blog post, so stay tuned.

# Conclusion

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading this introductory post. I hope to
have some meatier content up shortly.

Enjoy!
