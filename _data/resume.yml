name: "Charles A. Beynon"
title: "Full Stack Web Developer"
copy: >
  With over five years of experience as a systems administrator, IT generalist,
  and computer instructor in K-8 education, I'm looking to move on to a more
  hands-on, full-stack developer role.

more:
  I've been preparing over the last three years, including completion of a
  coding boot camp, self-study, and a number of personal projects. My primary
  back-end language is Ruby on Rails, with testing in RSpec/Capybara, and the
  front-end in HTML/HAML/SCSS. I am currently diving deep into AngularJS, and
  I'm always exposing myself to new technologies to keep a fresh mind and
  broader outlook.

  Ideally, I'm looking for a team committed (as I am) to rigorous engineering
  practices but that also recognizes the human aspect; that software is written
  by, and for, people. I consider a heavy use of pair-programming, test-driven
  development, and continuous integration; a focus on communication between team
  members/clients; and a commitment to developer growth through mentorship and
  professional development; to be strong indicators of a team I'll be successful at.
