Way back in high school (so the mid-to-late XXX0's), when AOL Instant Messanger
was the go-to communication tool, I had a problem. We had just switched from AOL
to prodigy and I couldn't transfer my old screen name to a free account. Having
just competed on the county math team at state and national competitions (yes, I
know...nerd), I had this awesome tee shirt with [Euler's Identity][eulers-id]
emblazoned on it. Thus my current online nom-de-plume
[eToThePiIPower][eToThePiIPower] was born.

Unfortunately, its a bit hard to spell, and sans serif fonts make it easily
mistakable, so I simplified it a bit when choosing a domain name.

# Background

My name is **Charles Beynon**, and I'm a full stack developer. I'm also a
recovering sysadmin.
