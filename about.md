# Background

My name is Charles Beynon. I'm a full stack developer, science geek, and tech
buff living in New York City. My blog contains my thoughts, ideas, and
experiments in software, technology, science, and probably anything else I feel
enthused enough to write about and published.

Prior to transitioning to development I spent close to ten years as a systems
administrator and educator in a K-8 private school; before *that* I obtained an
undergraduate degree in Mathematical Physics. I've been coding in some form or
another for nearly twenty years; it's just recently that I'm getting paid to
code full-time.

## Where does the name come from

Way back in high school (so the mid-to-late XXX0's), when AOL Instant Messanger
was the go-to communication tool, I had a problem. We had just switched from AOL
to prodigy and I couldn't transfer my old screen name to a free account. Having
just competed on the county math team at state and national competitions (yes, I
know...nerd), I had this awesome tee shirt with [Euler's Identity][eulers-id]
emblazoned on it. Thus my current online nom-de-plume
[eToThePiIPower][eToThePiIPower] was born.

Unfortunately, its a bit hard to spell, and sans serif fonts make it easily
mistakable, so I simplified it a bit when choosing a domain name.

[eulers-id]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity "Euler's Identity"
[eToThePiIPower]: https://github.com/eToThePiIPower
