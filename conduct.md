## Purpose

A primary goal of *{{ site.title }}* is to be inclusive to the largest number
of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such,
we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended --- a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
the comment sections, as well as the consequences for unacceptable
behavior.

We invite all those who participate in the *{{ site.title }}* comments section
to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Creating a Welcoming and Inclusive Culture

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is
essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that
exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is
welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the
fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

## Expected Behavior

The following are expected and requested of all community members:

* Be friendly and patient, both with the author(s) and each other.
* Be welcoming. We are striving to offer a community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
  members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration
  status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
  gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
  religion, and mental and physical ability.
* Be respectful. Not everyone will agree all of the time, but disagreement is no
  excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It is important to remember than
  when offering criticism or pointing out errors, the goal is not to prove your
  own superiority but to increase everybody's understanding.
* Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals
  (or at least aspiring professionals!), and as such we conduct ourselves
  professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
  participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.
  This includes but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats.
  * Discriminatory jokes.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
    information.
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then
    stop.
* Moderators reserve the right to delete posts which they feel violate these
  terms.
* Content that has been identified as objectionable, inappropriate, off-topic,
  spam, or illegal will be subject to deletion.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action
deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion
from the community without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify us as soon as possible by contacting use on Twitter or
via email.
